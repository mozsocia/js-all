How do I make an HTTP request in Javascript?
There are several ways to make an HTTP request in JavaScript, including using the XMLHttpRequest object, the fetch() function, and libraries such as jQuery and Axios.

Using the XMLHttpRequest object:

Copy code
```js
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("GET", "https://example.com", true);
xhr.send();
```
Using the fetch() function:

Copy code
```js
fetch("https://example.com")
  .then(function(response) {
    return response.text();
  })
  .then(function(data) {
    console.log(data);
  });
```
Using jQuery:

Copy code
```js
$.ajax({
  type: "GET",
  url: "https://example.com",
  success: function(data) {
    console.log(data);
  }
});
```
Using Axios:

Copy code
```js
axios.get("https://example.com")
  .then(function(response) {
    console.log(response.data);
  });
```
Note that these examples all use the GET HTTP method, but you can also use POST, PUT, DELETE, etc, by changing the first argument passed to the open() method or the type property accordingly. Also, this is basic examples and you may need to handle error, status code and other things as per your use case.

Sure! Here's an example of using the XMLHttpRequest object to make an HTTP GET request to retrieve data from a web server:

Copy code
```js
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

xhr.open("GET", "https://example.com", true);

xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
        // The request is complete and the data has been received successfully
        var data = xhr.responseText;
        console.log(data);
    }
}

xhr.send();
```
In this example, we first create a new XMLHttpRequest object. Then we use the open() method to specify the type of request (GET), the URL of the resource we want to retrieve (https://example.com), and whether the request should be made asynchronously (true).

We set an event listener on xhr object using onreadystatechange which will be triggered everytime the readyState of the xhr object changes.

In the event listener function, we check if the readyState is 4 and the status is 200. If this is the case, it means that the request has completed successfully and the response is ready. We use the responseText property to retrieve the data from the server, which we then log to the console.

We use send() method to initiate the request to the server.

It's worth noting that the readyState of the request goes through several states during the process of a request. You can use it to check the progress of the request and take appropriate action.

0: request not initialized
1: server connection established
2: request received
3: processing request
4: request finished and response is ready

Also, the status codes returned by the server can give you more information about the success or failure of the request.
200 : OK
404 : Not Found
500 : Internal Server Error
and so on

You can handle each status code differently.

error handling?
In the previous example, I did not include error handling. Here is an example of how you might handle errors when using the XMLHttpRequest object:

Copy code
```js
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

xhr.open("GET", "https://example.com", true);

xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
        if (xhr.status === 200) {
            // The request is complete and the data has been received successfully
            var data = xhr.responseText;
            console.log(data);
        } else {
            // An error occurred while making the request
            console.error(`Request failed with status code: ${xhr.status}`);
        }
    }
}

xhr.onerror = function() {
    console.error("An error occurred while making the request.");
}

xhr.send();
```
In this example, we've added an additional check for the status of the request after the readyState has reached 4. If the status is not 200, we log an error message to the console, with the status code of the error.

We have also added a separate event listener for the "error" event, which is triggered when a network error occurs. In this event listener function, we log an error message to the console.

It's important to handle errors when making HTTP requests to ensure that your application can handle and recover from unexpected situations, such as a server being unavailable or a user being offline.

You can also use try-catch statement while using xhr object, it is generally preferred when making synchronous request and allows you more fine-grained control over error handling.

Copy code
```js
try {
    xhr.open("GET", "https://example.com", false);
    xhr.send();
    if (xhr.status === 200) {
        var data = xhr.responseText;
        console.log(data);
    } else {
        console.error(`Request failed with status code: ${xhr.status}`);
    }
} catch (err) {
    console.error("An error occurred while making the request.");
}
```
It's worth noting that, the try-catch works only when the third parameter of open() method is set to false, indicating a synchronous request.

detail Using the fetch() function with error handling
Sure, here's an example of using the fetch() function to make an HTTP GET request, along with error handling:

Copy code
```js
fetch("https://example.com")
  .then(function(response) {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.text();
  })
  .then(function(data) {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error);
  });
 ```
In this example, we use the fetch() function to make a GET request to the specified URL. The fetch() function returns a promise that resolves with a Response object, which we can use to access the data from the server.

We first use response.ok ( which is a convenience property that returns true if the response status is 200-299) to check if the response was successful (status code in the 200 range), if not we throw a new Error with status code of response.

Then, we use the text() method of the Response object to return the response body as a string, which we log to the console.

If an error occurs at any point during the chain of then calls, the error will be passed down to the catch block, where we log the error to the console.

You can also use response.json() method instead of response.text() if the response body is in JSON format.

Also if you want to handle specific status codes differently, you can check the status property of the response object and act accordingly.

It's worth noting that fetch() by default doesn't include cookies with requests or sends credentials like XMLHttpRequest() does. If you want to include cookies or credentials, you'll need to pass an options object as the second argument with credentials property set to 'include' or 'same-origin'.

Copy code
```js
fetch("https://example.com", {
    credentials: 'include'
  })
  .then(function(response) {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.text();
  })
  .then(function(data) {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error);
  });
  ```
